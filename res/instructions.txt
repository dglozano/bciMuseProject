Put the Muse headband tight on your forehead and behind your ears. The indicators below show
if the quality of the signal that the sensorsare receiving is good or not: 1 indicates it is
perfect whereas a 4 means it is very bad. Adjust the headband until you get a good connection
that lasts, at least, more than 5 seconds. Afterwards, press Start to continue with the
experiment. Five videos of 30 seconds each will be displayed, with a 10 seconds gap between
each of them. Try to stay quiet, do not move your body nor your head, and do not blink too much.

Thanks!
